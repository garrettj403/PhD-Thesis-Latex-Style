PhD Thesis: LaTeX Files
=======================

I've had a couple people ask me for LaTeX source files for my PhD thesis. 

Well... here they are.

It's mostly based on the `ociamthesis` class by Keith A. Gillow, but I also made some tweaks. I stripped out a majority of the text and figures from my thesis, but I left the bones so that you can see how I structured the files.
