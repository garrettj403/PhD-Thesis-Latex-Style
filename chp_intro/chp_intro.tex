In this thesis, we investigate new techniques to increase the sensitivity of Superconductor/Insulator/Superconductor (SIS) receivers. These receivers are commonly used in astronomy for high resolution spectroscopy at frequencies between ${\sim}$100~GHz and ${\sim}$1.3~THz. Among other applications, these measurements are vital for studying the emission lines from cold molecular gas in the interstellar medium. Here, we present two new SIS receiver projects centred around 230~GHz. The first is an SIS receiver with wide instantaneous bandwidth, which allows multiple emission lines to be observed simultaneously. The second is an array of SIS receivers, which allows for more pixels to be contained within a single telescope, thereby increasing the mapping speed and field-of-view. In addition to this work, we also present observations of molecular gas in intermediate redshift galaxies, i.e., galaxies that are approximately 300~million to 5~billion light-years away.

\caption[Noise temperature of the ALMA receivers.]{The noise temperature of the ALMA SIS receivers. The solid horizontal lines represent the ALMA noise temperature specifications, and the dashed lines are the values that must be met over at least 80\% of the band. The dots are the measured noise temperature values from the literature:
Band~3 \citea{Claude},
Band~4 \citea{Asayama2014}, 
Band~5 \citea{Billade2012},
Band~6 \citea{Ediss2004},
Band~7 \citea{Mahieu2012},
Band~8 \citea{Shan2005},
Band~9 \citea{Baryshev2015}, and
Band~10 \citea{Fujii2013}. 
Note that the Band~3 results are out-dated; more recent results can be found in~\cite{Kerr2014}, but this paper does not list the noise temperature versus LO frequency. Also note that Bands 3--7 are SSB receivers and Bands 8--10 are DSB receivers.}
